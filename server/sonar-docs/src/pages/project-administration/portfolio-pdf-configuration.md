*PDF Reports are available as part of the [Enterprise Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/enterprise.html) and [above](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/).*

PDF reports give a periodic, high-level overview of the overall code quality and security of your projects, applications, or portfolios.

## Project and Application PDF Reports
