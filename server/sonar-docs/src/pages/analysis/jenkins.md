SonarScanners running in Jenkins can automatically detect branches and Merge or Pull Requests in certain jobs. You don't need to explicitly pass the branch or Pull Request details.

## Analysis Prerequisites

To run project analysis with Jenkins, you need to install and configure the following Jenkins plugins _in Jenkins_:
 
- The SonarQube Scanner plugin.
- The Branch Source plugin that corresponds to your ALM (Bitbucket Server, GitHub, or GitLab) if you're analyzing multibranch pipeline jobs in [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html) or above. 

See the **Installing and Configuring your Jenkins plugins** section below for more information.

### Configuring Jenkins through the SonarQube tutorial

You can easily configure and analyze your projects with Jenkins through the tutorial in SonarQube. 

[[info]]
| You need to set up SonarQube to import your repositories before accessing the tutorial. See the **ALM Integrations** in the left-side navigation of this documentation for more information.
|
| A tutorial is currently available for all supported ALMs except Azure DevOps.

To access the tutorial:

1. Click the **Add project** drop-down in the upper-right corner of the **Projects** page in SonarQube and select your DevOps platform.
1. Select the repository you want to import into SonarQube.
1. When asked **How do you want to analyze your repository?**, select **With Jenkins**.

See the **Installing and Configuring your Jenkins plugins** section below to set up your Jenkins plugins before going through the tutorial. 

## Configuring Single Branch Pipeline jobs
With Community Edition, you can only analyze a single branch. For more information, see the [SonarScanner for Jenkins](/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-jenkins/) documentation.

## Configuring Multibranch Pipeline jobs 
 
Starting in [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html), you can analyze multiple branches and Pull Requests. The automatic configuration of branches and Pull Requests relies on environment variables available in Multibranch Pipeline jobs. These are set based on information exported by Jenkins plugins. 

For configuration examples, see the [SonarScanner for Jenkins](/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-jenkins/) documentation.

### Configuring Multibranch Pipeline jobs for Pull Request Decoration
You need to configure your Multibranch Pipeline job correctly to avoid issues with Pull Request decoration. From your Multibranch Pipeline job in Jenkins, go to **Configure > Branch Sources > Behaviors**.

For Bitbucket and GitHub, under **Discover pull requests from origin**, make sure **The current pull request revision** is selected.

For GitLab, under **Discover merge requests from origin**, make sure **The current merge request revision** is selected.
